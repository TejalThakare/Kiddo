          <h5 className="description">Proper Diet Plan For Your child</h5>
          <p className="desc-para">
          For toddlers between 3 to 4 years old, their diet should continue to focus on providing a variety of nutritious foods to support their growth and development. At this age, toddlers are often more independent eaters but still require guidance and supervision to ensure they're getting a balanced diet. Here's a general diet plan for toddlers in this age range:<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Fruits and Vegetables:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables daily, aiming for at least 1 to 1.5 cups of each per day. Include a variety of colors and textures to ensure a wide range of nutrients.</li>
            <li>
            Examples include sliced apples, berries, bananas, oranges, steamed carrots, broccoli florets, bell pepper strips, and cucumber slices.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Grains:</h5><br></br>
          Include whole grains in your toddler's diet, such as whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, and whole grain pasta. Aim for about 3 to 5 servings of grains per day, depending on your child's appetite and activity level.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Proteins:</h5><br></br>
          Offer lean sources of protein such as poultry (chicken, turkey), lean cuts of beef or pork, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (beans, lentils), and dairy products (cheese, yogurt). Aim for about 2 to 3 servings of protein-rich foods per day.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Dairy:</h5><br></br>
          Continue offering whole milk or switch to reduced-fat milk if recommended by your pediatrician. Aim for about 2 to 3 servings of dairy per day, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, to ensure your child gets enough calcium for healthy bones and teeth.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Healthy Fats</h5><br></br>
          Include sources of healthy fats in your toddler's diet, such as avocado, nut butters (if there are no allergies), seeds (flaxseeds, chia seeds), and olive oil. Healthy fats are important for brain development and overall health.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Snacks:</h5><br></br>
          Offer healthy snacks between meals to keep your toddler energized and satisfied. Good options include sliced fruits, cut-up vegetables, whole grain crackers, cheese cubes, yogurt, nuts, and homemade trail mix.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Hydration:</h5><br></br>
          Encourage your toddler to drink water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Limit sugary drinks such as soda, fruit juices, and flavored milk, as they can contribute to tooth decay and provide empty calories.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Mealtime Tips:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Involve your toddler in meal planning and preparation to encourage their interest in healthy eating.</li>
            <li>Offer a balanced mix of foods at each meal, including a protein source, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Be patient and flexible. Toddlers may be picky eaters and may not always eat everything you offer. Offer a variety of nutritious options and let your child decide how much to eat.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Safety Considerations:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, and hard candies. Cut food into small, bite-sized pieces to reduce the risk of choking.</li>
            <li>Supervise your toddler during meal times to ensure they are eating safely and appropriately.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>

          Remember to consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and recommendations based on your toddler's individual needs, preferences, and any dietary restrictions or allergies they may have.
