          <h5 className="description">Proper Diet Plan For Your Baby</h5>
          <p className="desc-para">
          For babies between 1 to 2 years old, their diet continues to evolve as they grow and become more independent eaters. Here's a general diet plan for toddlers in this age range:<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Breast Milk or Formula:</h5><br></br>
          If your toddler is still breastfeeding, continue to offer breast milk as long as both you and your child desire. If your child has been weaned off breast milk or formula, they can transition to whole milk.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Whole Milk:</h5><br></br>
          Offer whole milk as a main drink, as it provides essential fats and nutrients for growing toddlers. Aim for about 16 to 24 ounces of whole milk per day. Avoid offering low-fat or skim milk until your child is at least 2 years old.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Fruits and Vegetables:</h5><br></br>
          Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables in different colors and textures. Encourage your toddler to eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables to ensure they get a wide range of vitamins and minerals.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Grains:</h5><br></br>
          Introduce a variety of grains, including whole grains such as whole wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal, and whole grain pasta. Offer grains as part of meals and snacks to provide energy and fiber.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Proteins:</h5><br></br>
          Include sources of protein such as lean meats (chicken, turkey, beef), fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (beans, lentils), and dairy products (cheese, yogurt). Aim for about 2 servings of protein-rich foods per day.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Healthy Fats:</h5><br></br>
          Offer foods rich in healthy fats such as avocado, nut butters (if there are no allergies), and olive oil. Healthy fats are important for brain development and overall growth.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Snacks:</h5><br></br>
          Offer healthy snacks between meals to keep your toddler energized and satisfied. Good options include sliced fruits, cut-up vegetables, whole grain crackers, cheese cubes, yogurt, and homemade muffins or energy balls.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Hydration:</h5><br></br>
          Offer water throughout the day to keep your toddler hydrated. Avoid sugary drinks such as soda, fruit juices, and flavored milk, as they can contribute to tooth decay and provide empty calories.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Mealtime Tips:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage self-feeding and independence during meal times, but be prepared to assist as needed.</li>
            <li>Offer a variety of foods at each meal to expose your toddler to different flavors and textures.</li>
            <li>Be patient and flexible. Toddlers may be picky eaters and may not always eat everything you offer. Offer a variety of nutritious options and let your child decide how much to eat.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Safety Considerations:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, and hard candies. Cut food into small, bite-sized pieces to reduce the risk of choking.</li>
            <li>Supervise your toddler during meal times to ensure they are eating safely and appropriately.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>

          As always, consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and recommendations based on your toddler's individual needs and development.
